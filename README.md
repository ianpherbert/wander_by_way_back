<h1>Wander By Way</h1>
<p>This is very much a work in progress</p>

<p>Wander by Way is (or will be) an app that allows users to find unusual routes from / to destinations</p>
<p>the inspiration comes from my favourite way of travelling, wandering</p>

<p>Built with Spring Boot, Kotlin, mongoDB and Graphql, this API aggregates route data from several different sources in order to show all routes from a point.</p>
